# Fix Suggestions Functionality

## Problem

The suggestions functionality is showing "Failed to fetch users for suggestions" error. This is likely due to database issues with the profiles table or RLS policies.

## Solution

Run the SQL script `FIX_SUGGESTIONS_FUNCTIONALITY.sql` in your Supabase dashboard.

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Open Supabase Dashboard**

   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to the SQL Editor

2. **Run the SQL Script**

   - Copy the entire content of `FIX_SUGGESTIONS_FUNCTIONALITY.sql`
   - Paste it into the SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" to execute the script

3. **What the Script Does:**

   - Disables RLS temporarily to ensure data can be inserted
   - Clears and recreates all user profiles with proper data
   - Sets up correct RLS policies for the profiles table
   - Ensures the friends table exists with proper structure
   - Adds sample friend relationships for testing
   - Creates a test query to verify suggestions work

4. **Expected Results:**
   - All 4 users (Jack, Marium, suleman, sam) will be in the profiles table
   - Suggestions should now work properly
   - Users who are not friends will appear in suggestions
   - The error "Failed to fetch users for suggestions" should be resolved

## Verification

After running the script, you should see:

- 4 profiles in the profiles table
- 3 friend relationships in the friends table
- Suggestions working properly in the Dashboard

## If Issues Persist

If you still see errors after running the script:

1. Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that all users are properly authenticated
3. Ensure the Supabase client is properly configured
4. Try refreshing the page after running the SQL script
